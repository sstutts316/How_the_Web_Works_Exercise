# How_the_Web_Works_Exercise

## What is HTTP?
HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol): It's a protocol used for transferring data over the web. It defines how messages are formatted and transmitted, and how web servers and browsers should respond to various commands.

## What is a URL?
URL (Uniform Resource Locator): It's a web address that specifies the location of a resource on the internet. It includes the protocol (e.g., HTTP), domain name (e.g., somesite.com), and path to the resource (e.g., /some/page.html).


## What is DNS?
DNS (Domain Name System): It's a system that translates human-readable domain names (e.g., somesite.com) into IP addresses (e.g., 192.168.1.1), allowing computers to locate each other on the internet.


## What is a query string?
Query String: It's a part of a URL that follows a question mark and contains key-value pairs, used to pass data to a web server. For example, in ?name=John&age=30, "name" and "age" are keys, and "John" and "30" are their respective values.


## What are two HTTP verbs and how are they different?
HTTP Verbs: Two common HTTP verbs are GET (retrieve data) and POST (submit data). GET is for requesting data, while POST is for sending data to the server for processing.


## What is an HTTP request?
HTTP Request: It's a message sent by a client (e.g., browser) to a server, specifying an action to be performed. It includes a request method, URL, headers, and optional data.


## What is an HTTP response?
HTTP Response: It's a message sent by a web server to a client in response to an HTTP request. It contains requested data or information about the request's outcome.


## What is an HTTP header? Give a couple examples of request and response headers you have seen.
HTTP Header: It's metadata in HTTP requests and responses that provides additional information. 
Examples: User-Agent (request), Content-Type (response), Authorization (request), and Location (response).


## What are the processes that happen when you type “http://somesite.com/some/page.html” into a browser?
Processes When Typing a URL:

-DNS Resolution: Convert domain name to IP.
-Establish TCP Connection: Connect to the server.
-HTTP Request: Send a request to the server.
-Server Processing: Server handles the request.
-HTTP Response: Server sends a response.
-Rendering: Browser displays the page.
-Additional Requests: Fetch linked resources.
-Page Display: Fully render and display the web page.
-Caching (optional): Store resources for future use.

### These answers provide a concise overview of key concepts related to HTTP, URLs, DNS, HTTP verbs, requests, responses, headers, and the processes when entering a URL in a browser.
